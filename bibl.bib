	abstract = "{In this paper we present a derivation of the surface Helmholtz decomposition, discuss its relation to the surface Hodge decomposition and derive a well-posed stream function formulation of a class of surface Stokes problems. We consider a \\$C^2\\$ connected (not necessarily simply connected) oriented hypersurface \\$\\varGamma \\subset \\mathbb\\{R\\}^3\\$ without boundary. The surface gradient, divergence, curl and Laplace operators are defined in terms of the standard differential operators of the ambient Euclidean space \\$\\mathbb\\{R\\}^3\\$. These representations are very convenient for the implementation of numerical methods for surface partial differential equations. We introduce surface \\$\\mathbf H(\\{\\mathop\\{\\rm div\\}\\}\_\\{\\varGamma\\})\\$ and \\$\\mathbf H(\\{\\mathop\\{\\rm curl\\}\\}\_\\{\\varGamma\\})\\$ spaces and derive useful properties of these spaces. A main result of the paper is the derivation of the Helmholtz decomposition, in terms of these surface differential operators, based on elementary differential calculus. As a corollary of this decomposition we obtain that for a simply connected surface to every tangential divergence-free velocity field there corresponds a unique scalar stream function. Using this result the variational form of the surface Stokes equation can be reformulated as a well-posed variational formulation of a fourth-order equation for the stream function. The latter can be rewritten as two coupled second-order equations, which form the basis for a finite element discretization. A particular finite element method is explained and the results of a numerical experiment with this method are presented.}",
